# Conch AI Frontend Test

Hello and welcome to our test for our software engineering role! We made this quick test and wish you all the best.

Please create a fork of this repo and submit a link to your repo when you are done.

## Test Description

This project just contains one page: `index.js` (the landing page).

However, the load time for this page is extremely high due to:
- A .gif video
- Numerous images

Especially for mobile, the load time can be very high.

## Test Challenge

The challenge is to significantly decrease the load time for the page.

One suggested method may be to cache the images and the gif. However, if you have other ideas or can integrate better strategies, even better!

## Bonus Challenge:

- There is a "Error: Hydration failed" on the page. You don't need to fix this bug (pressing refresh or closing the error) will still cause the page to function. However, if you can find a way to fix this bug, that's a big bonus
